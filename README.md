I had to investigate different classifiers / models and evaluate their performance on their suitability for the sentiment classification / opinion mining problem. We used nltk's twitter dataset and classifiers from other libraries and eventually documented results and investigated possible reasons for their difference in performance as well as ways in which the performance could have been increased. Multiple techniques were used to clean the data such as regular expressions, tokenization as well as various stemming, lemmatization and vectorization algorithms.
